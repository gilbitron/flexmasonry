# FlexMasonry

FlexMasonry is a lightweight, zero-dependency, masonry (cascading grid layout) library powered by CSS flexbox. The library itself is inspired by [this article by Tobias Ahlin](https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/masonry-with-css/) on using `flex`, `:nth-child()`, and `order` to create a pure CSS masonry layout (as opposed to the hugely popular [Masonry library by David DeSandro](https://masonry.desandro.com/) that is powered by Javascript). I've taken this concept and sprinkled in some Javascript to tie it all together and make it easy to use.

## Features

- **Lightweight** - Just 6KB of JS and CSS
- **Fast** - Uses CSS flexbox for layout
- **Responsive** - Show different number of columns at different breakpoints
- **Simple** - Just 3 options

[See a demo](https://flexmasonry.now.sh/)

## Install

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gilbitron/flexmasonry/releases).
- Clone this repo.
- Install using NPM/Yarn:

```
npm install flexmasonry
yarn add flexmasonry
```

Then, include the `flexmasonry.js` and `flexmasonry.css` files from the `dist` folder in your HTML. Or you can use the files directly from a CDN:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/flexmasonry/dist/flexmasonry.css"
/>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/flexmasonry/dist/flexmasonry.js"></script>
```

## Usage

Set up your HTML. For example:

```html
<div class="grid">
  <div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/t3DHojIo-08" alt="" /></div>
  <div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/Imc-IoZDMXc" alt="" /></div>
  <div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/SOZWHqeXcPQ" alt="" /></div>
  <div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/bkdzvgBB7rQ" alt="" /></div>
  <div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/Aruugw_rJCM" alt="" /></div>
</div>
```

Then hook up the script, passing in the selector target:

```js
FlexMasonry.init(".grid");
```

FlexMasonry will then convert all `.grid` elements to masonry grids with multiple columns.

## Options

The second, optional, parameter of the `init` method is an object containing options. The default options are as follows:

```js
{
    /*
     * If `responsive` is `true`, `breakpointCols` will be used to determine
     * how many columns a grid should have at a given responsive breakpoint.
     */
    responsive: true,
    /*
     * A list of how many columns should be shown at different responsive
     * breakpoints, defined by media queries.
     */
    breakpointCols: {
        'min-width: 1500px': 6,
        'min-width: 1200px': 5,
        'min-width: 992px': 4,
        'min-width: 768px': 3,
        'min-width: 576px': 2,
    },
    /*
     * If `responsive` is `false`, this number of columns will always be shown,
     * no matter the width of the screen.
     */
    numCols: 4,
    /*
     * If you want to give gap between of the columns/row
     */
    gap: 0,
}
```

For example, to always shown 6 columns in your grid:

```js
FlexMasonry.init(".grid", {
  responsive: false,
  numCols: 6,
  gap: 2,
});
```

## Methods

The `FlexMasonry` variable has several methods:

**`init(targets, options = {})`**

Initialises the FlexMasonry library and sets up the `targets` as masonry grids.

- `targets` can be a string, an array of elements or a `Nodeâ€‹List`.
- `options` [see above](#options).

**`refresh(target, options = {})`**

Refreshes the `target` grid layout.

- `target` must be an `Element`.
- `options` [see above](#options).

**`refreshAll(options = {})`**

Refreshes the grid layouts of all `targets` passed to `init()`.

- `options` [see above](#options).

**`destroyAll()`**

Removes the event listeners for all `targets` passed to `init()`.

## Development

Run `yarn` to install the dependencies and use `demo/index.html` to test things. To watch/build the library:

```
yarn watch
yarn build
```

## FAQ

> Why not just use pure CSS?

A good question! You _can_ use pure CSS to achieve the same outcome. However, there are several aspects of this setup that require a bit of "dynamic" updating to make it flexible and easy to use (hence the use of Javascript). The main one being that the masonry container requires a fixed height (which FlexMasonry calculates on the fly). Also the masonry container needs a certain number of "break" elements to work properly depending on the number of columns. To enable this, and to support having a different number of columns at different responsive breakpoints, we need Javascript.
